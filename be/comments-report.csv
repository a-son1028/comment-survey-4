2,"New app jumps around as I'm reading due to pop up's and ads loading making it difficult to read news. It's basically not a simple app anymore. Also, I can no longer share a story with a simple link. The app requires full 3rd party access to my contacts which I won't allow for obvious privacy reasons. I like news 9 but I'll probably be moving away from this app until it become easy to use again.",news 9,,x,,,

8,Works amazingly overall and I absolutely love it! Now I don't have to have people constantly looking at my things and ruining privacy.

11,"Solid. One gripe: if for any reason I'm using my computer and my phone isn't synced at that time (be it the phone is turned off, or I don't have BT enabled) I get a windows security flag in the task bar that I can't dismiss until the phone is all synced up properly again. Not the end of the world, but not being able to dismiss notifications like this is a bit of a pet peeve. It wasn't a security issue to not have a phone synced to my computer before I installed this application, why is it now",your phone companion - link to windows,x,x,,,
12,"Do not use this app, it totally violates your privacy/security without warning. There is a basic interface with a few functions, one of which unexpectedly launches a full instance of the PC version of GIMP on a server, sending your image there. Worse, this server reuses guest accounts, so not only does the server admin have access to your stuff, so do other random people. Only upside is that the data usage _suggests_ that it only sends the selected image, and not everything on your phone ...",xgimp image editor,x,x,,,

19,"The app works fine now and is very useful but it has a huge flaw: There is no way to secure the app. If someone has access to your computer they can see all the data and everything you are doing on your phone. You need to have a proximity sensor (BT? NFC?) that locks the connection when you are away from your computer. Or some kind of password or other security feature.

23,This needs to be more Andriod compatible since it is a alternate store it really needs to have all available apk's this offers as a link to the same available install on Google play. Really all  apk install options need to be mirrored on Play Store  available through Google instead of the MS Lord of Servers creating Security holes in alternate security locations and division in the OS certification approval .  Basicly unknown sources is the source of the functionality issue the last time I utilized this app and was all unknown installs then appeared as if I had it from play. This is not ok Microsoft!

Spoke to employees & they are not paid well in most areas outside of places like SF and will get offended if you don't tip. With that being said it's not free shipping and handling, or it is but you risk god knows what happening to your food before getting to you, or ect (risky).

As a result... I've now moved over fully to Google. Some will have concerns over privacy, adds, etc... but the same can now be said for MS apps.

38,I love this app! I have friends and family across the globe and keep track of their weather to more accurately pray for them each day. I especially needed the hurricane/typhoon tracker. It keeps me updated on weather events effecting my loved ones. First weather app I have found to also include hurricanes and typhoons. I get weather and hurricane alerts 24/7 for all my locations I have bookmarked! Win-win. Definitely worth the $12.99 a year fee. My TrendMicro Mobile Security Software also scanned it and it was safe to keep on my phone. Every app HAS to be approved by TrendMicro to stay be my phone. The one thing I wish it has that isn't weather related is; virus outbreaks. I LOVE this app!üòä The info is easy to read. 5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,clime: noaa weather radar live,x,,,,

There is a trouble shooting app for Windows, it runs a fake security scan, reports unspecified problems and says McAfee must be purchased.

But it's not typically more than once a week so it's not a dealbreaker. Seems like they're a bit overly vigilant about security (many of us live alone and nobody touches our devices, ever -- yeah, I know, boohoo!). Also, the QR code thing almost NEVER works, but the solution to that is to know your passwords. (I also use Pulse to do SMS via PC and don't have these same pairing issues and pulse has a great rep, security wise, but whatever). I still like the app. It's free, doesn't have ads (that I've noticed) and doesn't glom a ton of resources and if you have two phones with two different numbers you can combine it with the Pulse app (or some other mobile to pc app) to access two different numbers on your pc.",your phone companion - link to windows,x,,,,

Secondly, you can make an option to add notes to the different items and sub items as reminders of important things related to the tasks. Thirdly, you can add an option to change the font color of the words in the items and subitems just to make things look more cheerful. In addition, you can provide an option for hiding lists; this means that the list is not deleted but is also not displayed, and this can be useful for privacy and for hiding stuff that is not urgent or needed but shall not be deleted.

742,"It's nice that it doesn't require location access to function like other services which is extremely invasive and that there's a Nielsen opt-out, that's enough to choose Sling over the competition but not enough to blindly trust it overall. Kudos nevertheless to Sling. Navigation is horribly complicated, real appliances are the most underpowered and clunky things and --even with all the power available to Android TV boxes-- this manages to get it worse. You can't just start watching and [2] change up/down like a regular tuner/recorder. It's easy to get out of the channel and get lost. Ads for subscription upgrades are annoyingly shown and it's dangerously easy to do so if you don't have controls to prevent it--not easy to set them either. Normal boxes are always recording and thus you can always rewind and forward during live TV. Here, transport controls are locked even if you start recording and back all the way out to home to go find the ongoing recording. It won't work. Transport controls are only available when the recording has finished -- that's not how normal single or multi-tuner DVR work. Sling is supposed to be an unlimited-tuner DVR. You can't channel surf because [1] you lose immediately progress (even if recording) of what you're watching and because of 2. Lastly, there's this thing, I think it's a bug but it's related of how advertisements are *obviously* dynamically loaded that I think the server can't be found and therefore it may take as much as 15min when an ads start and then it does to black screens between ads and when they finally finishes playing them it returns to live TV but by then you missed most of the transmission. I have a 300Mbps, 1ms latency connection; the problem is not there, it happens mostly on Apple TV though, not so much on Android TV. ‚Äì I would give it 2 stars if it wasn't for the location/privacy thing.","sling: live tv, shows & movies",x,x,,,

This isn't even close to a 1 star app, and it isn't worthless... but there are a lot of serious limitations.

So it doesn't work over the internet/cell network, Bluetooth is ignored, etc.    The only way this will work is if you are at home, or someplace where you're connecting a laptop and phone to the same wifi network (I'm not even sure if someplace like Starbucks would work: they may not allow communication between wifi clients for security reasons).    But if it fits your situation, or you're tech savvy enough to want to jump through the hoops of getting it connected (you could set up a wifi network just between your computer and the phone) then it could be kinda useful, but it would be a zillion times easier to just use a USB cable to transfer pics.",your phone companion - link to windows,x,x,,,

In instances I barely held the toothbrush against my teeth and then I got a warning for too much pressure applied. 4. The interval to switch to the next section of teeth is also to short for my liking. The other reason why I cannot recommend this app is because of privacy and location. I can understand that a Bluetooth connection is needed between the toothbrush and your mobile device, but not the location.

968,"EDIT: Had to update this review to give less stars. Major flaw. Sometimes, the app doesn't lock. I haven't been able to find a pattern to this yet. Would be five stars if this didn't happen, otherwise it's effectively useless for privacy.   Original review: Great app for privacy. The only time someone could see a note is if you turned the screen off while on the note. They would have to film with a high speed camera to capture the split second that it takes the app to relock itself when the screen turns back on. On the list of open apps, it doesn't show a screenshot of the note. It sounds like you can't take screenshots which helps reduce the chance of any viruses stealing information. It backs up to Google drive if desired. I'm trying to look into how it is saved to the Google drive to make sure it is secure, encrypted, etc. One small change that would be nice is to ask for confirmation before deleting notes. There's a undo that can be done if noticed, but I almost swiped a note off to the side unintentionally, and I might not have noticed.",private notepad - safe notes,,x,,,

982,"UPDATE 2: after a few more ""updates"" I gave this another go - it STILL demands access to phone contacts, ability to manager PHONE CALLS plus one or two other permissions, ALL of which are irrelevant as I ONLY needed this to schedule Twitter posts (I already have an app to schedule SMS, which has always been flawless for me and Facebook has a native post schedule feature).  These ""permissions"" should be OPTIONAL, countless other apps make permissions optional and work perfectly well for the end-user.  UPDATE: after several updates I'm now not able to see if the below issue has been fixed, as the app demands access to my contacts and the ability to make calls, both of which are completely irrelevant to my needs, as I ONLY wanted to use this app to schedule Twitter posts!  Furthermore, these ""permissions"" should always be optional, from a basic security perspective if nothing else!  Only needed this for the Twitter function and it doesn't work, at all.  Tried scheduling several posts and every one resulted in a ""post Twitter failure"" (reason 403), claiming it's to do with an update limit.  Clearly not a 'device issue' and can't be to do with my usage since it hasn't once worked for me.

Some of these apps I use daily, and sometimes even (intentionally) click on the ads because they're well done and things that are relevant (yay future but also bye privacy). This, however, is a bridge too far. The ads have become so obtrusive they've rendered the app unusable. It's very unfortunate because I loved this app. Again, I understand they need to pay for things, but this is lost ad revenue.

Actually I started not liking it when I was setting it up. The app asked me to scan my passport, and I did, but there was no way to tell whether the scan was successful. Except, I guess, that it asked me later to enter my passport number manually. Another thing I did not like was the need to be connected to a wireless network. Connecting to wireless at an airport is dicey at best--I kept connecting and getting disconnected at Houston Hobby as I was walking toward customs, trying to get this thing to work. Why not allow phone data connection?  So as I entered the area where there was a separate line for the mobile passport, I got an error message after answering the security questions. I had to go through the entire process of setting up a ""new"" trip to try again. Then I got a different error message.

Also quick response from developer on feedback email which is rare.

And I think warning on opening malicious websites too is lacking.  2) Some websites .... like some mp3 download sites or football highlights showing websites etc. on clicking links or clicking to enter data causes redirecting to various websites like shopping websites .... to playstore to install an app or opens window warning you of problems with your device at the same time vigorously vibrating your device and asking you to click a link provided to correct it.   This is a major problem and must be rectified quickly.  3) There should be option of clearing data (selected by user) on exit.  4) It'll be great if the option to scan files before downloading is added.  5) In the tabs open section  .... too many tabs seem to be open even on closing websites. It's a bit confusing.  6) The search engine keeps reverting back to Yahoo though I select a different one ......   7) Would like to know why in some websites which show football highlights the videos cannot be played showing .... net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR   8) For some websites the default logo of the site is not getting set on adding to speed dial ..... a picture of globe is set.

The app itself takes forever to sync with the PSN servers and will often times white out and ask if you want to kill the app while updating.  I've had to tell my phone to wait more than twice while updating before.  Several trophy lists were in Japanese only.  I contacted the developer about this issue six months ago and while they responded quickly a fix was never implemented.  Right now, I'm unable to use the app completely because it does NOT support two-factor authentication.  I'd find it downright amusing that this app is actually WORSE than Sony in the security department if it weren't for the fact that I actually paid for this app.  I paid for the app, I'm extremely dissatisfied with how it handles on Android, and I'd advise against installing it.

I received a reply from Airside Mobile stating that there is no PII sent to Airside servers and that all PII is only stored on the device.  This can't possibly be true since they define PII as ""name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, passport number, date and place of birth, credit card number.""

2461,"1. Following the 2020-11-27 update, the opening screen showed a commercial advertisement (Amazon Prime film on dogs with a clear button to download the Amazon Prime app). The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äòconsole‚Äô (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äôs orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Ä¶ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time. Would increase battery life and user experience (less charging).",tractive gps dog and cat finder,,,x,x,x

The fact that you don't allow copy/paste or autofill is a huge joke. I use LastPass to generate and autofill a secure password for all of my accounts. By forcing users to actually type a password in, you're forcing me to use a password that's more easily rememberable and thus, unsecure.  You also have fairly strong password requirements (8 characters, upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols) which means you have at least one somewhat competent security expert so I'm pretty confused by your asinine decision to block pasting and autofill.",philips sonicare,x,,,,

2545,"Incredible how easy this app is to use and how quickly it breezes you through customs.  We literally walked off the plane, passed the lines of people waiting at the kiosks, entered a line dedicated to mobile passports, and waited 10 seconds while the customs guard finished the guy in front of us.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for our luggage to arrive, and were walking out before the rest of our plane was through customs.    A lot of people have expressed concerns about sharing passport information with a third party.  I get those concerns, but the app is approved by the CBP, and I'm sure they are very strict about how personal data can be used.  I could see there being extra security done behind the scenes - I wouldn't recommend using this if you're a known terrorist, for example - but even the in-app ""purchases"" are unintrusively listed at the end of your submission, or can be accessed through a separate 'services' menu (passport renewal and TSA pre-check applications are the only two I've seen).
